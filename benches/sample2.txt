The virus responsible for the pandemic that has engulfed the globe — <a href="https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6">sickening almost half a million and killing more than 20,000 worldwide</a> — is one of <a href="https://www.niaid.nih.gov/diseases-conditions/coronaviruses">hundreds</a> in the family of coronaviruses. Yet before the current outbreak, coronaviruses were poorly studied. They mostly circulate among animals, and in the few cases where<a href="https://www.niaid.nih.gov/diseases-conditions/coronaviruses"> they have infected humans</a>, they’ve mostly caused <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2020/03/biography-new-coronavirus/608338/">symptoms of the common cold</a>. And previous outbreaks of coronaviruses have been comparatively small. SARS and MERS together killed fewer people overall than <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/02/18/wuhan-china-coronavirus-hospital-director-dies-covid/4792597002/">this virus did</a> in dtem and makes it more difficult for people to breathe. … But the really serious problems seem to occur not just as a consequence of the infection itself but because of the body’s attempt to fight that infection. So the immune system will typically mount some kind of defense against the virus. But in some cases, that defense goes berserk. So the immune system radically overreacts and launches what is known as a cytokine storm. And those kinds of reactions, that cytokine storm, are pretty common for a lot of new and severe infections. We saw them with the 1918 flu pandemic. We saw them with, I think, the 2009 flu pandemic. A lot  of those is important right now, which means that we only have a very crude understanding of who is at risk and who is not.
